This is a sample script which makes a call to the https://randomuser.me/ API, getting a random user. The data received is being saved to a previously created sqlite3 based DataBase.

Before starting the above-mentioned steps the main.py is doing an automation test with pytest.

The whole process is containerised in a Docker container - Dockerfile. The containerisation is automated in the build.sh code.
